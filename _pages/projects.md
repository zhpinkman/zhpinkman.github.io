## Notable Projects

### Neural Networks

- Delved Deeper into the Memory Neural Networks from the most basic designs like auto-associative networks to the most complicated ones,
    Recurrent Neural Networks and their derivations such as LSTMs, GRUs, and Bert applied on bitcoin prices and texts extracted from tweets.
- Developed and learned principles of Convolutional Neural Networks and the models that fall under CNNs like inception model and U-net.
- Analyzed the applications of Generative Adversarial Networks and their derivatives like cycle-GANs alongside Variational Auto-Encoders. Also,
    Implemented a cycle-GAN using PyTorch framework.


### Reinforcement Learning

- Solved different n-armed bandit problems with different policies considering different criteria such as regret and average reward.
- Develop a load balancing framework on the famous jackâ€™s rental car problem using policy iteration algorithm.
- Analyzed different On-policy and Off-policy methods by comparing their accuracy and performance on different tasks.


### Data Science and AI

- Learned and applied the basic models in AI such as clustering and regression models on various datasets including the bank churners and
    house prices dataset.
- Analyzed different classification models such as random forests by applying them on different datasets and learning more about entropy and
    information-theory basics.
- Examined the performance of different searching algorithms such as A* and IDS on custom-built datasets.

### Advanced Programming

- Learned different design patterns and also clean coding principles by implementing a handful of programs.
- Get to know the basic elements of game design by designing a game from scratch using CPP programming language.

### Operating Systems

- Implemented a FTP-server using CPP including different features such as being able to tolerate a down server by switching to a UDP-based
    peer2peer network model between the individuals.
- Developed a load balancing system using semaphores.
- Learned the principles of multithreading and multiprocessing in operating systems by implementing a parallel classifier.

### Network and Network Security

- Implemented a p2p network with peers being able to find their neighbors, and check the tolerability of the system by turning off nodes at
    random.
- Implemented a FTP-server from scratch using Python language and socket-programming having various features such as being able to login to
    the server, check the available files and upload new files to the server.
- Examined RYU-controllers and different congestion control mechanisms.
- Analyzed and used different network security protocols and algorithms used to encrypt files and also mail security (SMIME)

### Compiler

- Implemented a compiler from scratch for a given language analogous to Java programming language.
- Learned and analyzed different design patterns particularly the ones used in language theory and compilers like Observer pattern by implementing
    different toy-tasks on this topic.
