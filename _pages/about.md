Welcome to my personal page

I am Zhivar Sourati, A senior Software Engineering student at the University of Tehran, and I work as a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak) at Data Analysis Lab located at the University of Tehran Science & Technology Park.

My research interest covers lots of areas such as **Social Network Analysis**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Statistical Inference**. Currently, I'm studying **non-parametric** approaches in hypothesis testing and **permutation tests** in **complex networks**. In general, I'm interested in solving machine learning and statistical learning problems that overlaps with **economics** and **social sciences**. 

Also, I'm finishing my bachelor studies and looking for master and PhD positions.
