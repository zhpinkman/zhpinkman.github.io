# Zhivar Sourati


Welcome to my page


I am Zhivar Sourati, a graduate research assistant in Information Science Institute at University of Southern California under the supervision of Dr. Filip Ilievski. Also before that, I was an NLP research intern at Zurich University of Applied Sciences under Dr. Don Tuggener and Dr. Mark Cieliebak working on Dialogue Summarization. The first experience that I had as a research assistant was also working on permutation tests, complex networks, and machine learning applications under the supervision of Dr. Behnam Bahrak.

My research interest covers many areas such as Commonsense Reasoning, Natural Language Processing, Statistical Inference, Knowledge Graphs, and Data Mining. 

Also, I'm generally interested in solving machine learning and statistical learning problems that overlap with economic, psychology and social sciences.
