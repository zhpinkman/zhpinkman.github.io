# Zhivar Sourati


Welcome to my page

I am Zhivar Sourati, an NLP research assistant in [Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/) at [Zurich University of Applied Sciences](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Cieliebak](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/ciel/) and [Dr. Don Tuggener](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/tuge/). Also, before that, I was a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak) at the Data Analytics Lab located at the University of Tehran.

My research interest covers many areas such as **Social Network Analysis**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Statistical Inference**, **Knowledge Graphs**, and **Data Mining**. 

Currently working on hate speech analysis in social networks, and different dialogue summarization approaches, such as graph-based and unsupervised ones using BART, KEYBERT, and other transformer models. Plus, developing an API that provides the mentioned functionalities and more as separate endpoints for extracting the most important sections of a meeting.

Also, I'm generally interested in solving machine learning and statistical learning problems that overlap with economics and social sciences.
