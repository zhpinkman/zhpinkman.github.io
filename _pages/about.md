# Zhivar Sourati


Welcome to my page

I am Zhivar Sourati, A senior Software Engineering student at the University of Tehran, and I work as a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak) at the Data Analytics Lab located at the University of Tehran.


My research interest covers many areas such as **Social Network Analysis**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Statistical Inference**. Currently, I’m studying **non-parametric** approaches in hypothesis testing and **permutation tests** in **complex networks**. I’m generally interested in solving machine learning and statistical learning problems that overlap with **economics** and **social sciences**.


Also, I’m finishing my bachelor's studies and looking for Ph.D. (or MSc) positions.
