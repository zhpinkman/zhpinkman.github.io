# Zhivar Sourati



I am Zhivar Sourati, a Ph.D. student at University of Southern California and a graduate research assistant at USC Information Science Institute (ISI) advised by Dr. Fred Morstatter and Dr. Filip Ilievski (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) focusing on analogical reasoning, prototype-based reasoning, and LLMs' cognitive and social capabilities and effects on generated text. Before joining USC, I was an NLP research intern at Zurich University of Applied Sciences collaborating with Dr. Don Tuggener and Dr. Mark Cieliebak working on Dialogue Summarization. The first experience that I had as a research assistant was working on permutation tests, complex networks, and machine learning applications in a team supervised by Dr. Behnam Bahrak.

My research interest covers many areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Social Network Analysis, Knowledge Graphs, Statistical Inference, and Data Mining. 

Also, I'm generally interested in solving machine learning and statistical learning problems that overlap with economics, psychology and social sciences.
