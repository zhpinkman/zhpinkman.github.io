## Research Experience

### Research Assistant under the Supervision of [Dr. Bahrak](https://profile.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak)

- Learned about complex networks, carried out multiple projects in this field, and read related papers, including surveys on analysis of the network of Twitter users.
- Analyzed the popularity of fanfictions using various attributes available on fanfictions, exploiting the tools and ideas discussed in social network analysis.
- Performed network inference on complex networks using various non-parametric tests, permutation tests, and exponential random graph models.
- Managed to collect all Persian tweets published from ten years ago until 2021 September, using two remote servers, one being used as a proxy tunnel and the second one as a database to store all the data in a well-structured format on Elastic.

### NLP Research Intern under the Supervision of [Dr. Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/)

- Read papers about NLP and developed a deep understanding of state-of-the-art NLP models.
- Learned different topics in NLP and implemented specific tasks such as [NER](https://github.com/zhpinkman/NER-model) and [QA chatbots](https://github.com/zhpinkman/chatbot-using-seq2seq) to learn NLP more practically.
